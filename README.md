# Crystal Collector Game

* There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

* The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

* When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

* The game hides the amount of points for each crystal until the player clicks a crystal.

* When they do click one, the player's score counter increases by that amount.

* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

* When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have new hidden values. The user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

* The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. 

* Have fun!
